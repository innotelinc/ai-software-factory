"""Push template changes into a repo that already ran `factory init`.

    python bin/sync-to.py ../tally
    python bin/sync-to.py ../tally --dry-run

WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT `cp -r`. The runner is COPIED into a repo and never
linked, so a fix here reaches nothing already built. That is a known cost. What is
not obvious is that the obvious command for paying it silently does not work: on Git
Bash for Windows, `cp -r src/. dst/` reports success and leaves the destination
untouched. Two rounds of a real fix were lost to that -- the same failure reproduced
after a fix that had, as far as anything visible said, been applied.

So this compares CONTENT, copies only what differs, and prints exactly what it
changed. A sync that did nothing says so.

IT NEVER TOUCHES THE THREE THINGS THAT ARE YOURS: MISSION.md, harness/END-TO-END.md and
.factory/holdout/. Those are the product, not the machinery, and overwriting them
with a scaffold is the one thing this must never do.

AND IT NEVER OVERWRITES A PROMPT YOU REWROTE. The node prompts and the skills are
the personalisation layer; they are add-only here, installed when missing and left
alone when present. "Missing" and "edited" are different questions, so a new prompt
still reaches an existing install.

    `factory/config.py` is on the NEVER list because it is the one file you edit --
    every project-specific value lives there, and overwriting it would throw those
    away. The consequence, which is not obvious until it bites: a new setting can
    never reach an existing install, and the synced code that reads it raises
    AttributeError at runtime, on whatever path happens to touch it first.

    Measured here: `BASE_BRANCH` was added, four modules were synced to use it, and
    the doctor died with `module 'config' has no attribute 'BASE_BRANCH'`. The sync
    reported success. So the sync now says what to add, and the operator pastes it in
    -- which keeps the file theirs while refusing to leave it silently incomplete.
