"""factory -- turn a repository into one that ships its own code.

    factory init            install the factory into this repo
    factory doctor          audit it; refuses a dial the evidence does not support

    factory halt | resume   the stop button
    factory status          what is in flight, and what the dial is

THE ENGINE COMES WITH IT. `init` installs Archon if it is not already here, the same
way installing OpenClaw gets you Pi: you asked for a factory, and the workflow engine
underneath is an implementation detail you are allowed to ignore until you want it.
When you do want it, it is a normal Archon install with a normal workflow pack in
`.archon/workflows/factory/`, and every workflow is a YAML file you can read,
edit, and run by hand.

NOTHING HERE IS CLEVER. It copies files, fills in what it can detect, and refuses to
turn anything on that has not been shown to work.

  refused one thing, four times.

  READ ORDER, for every node about to stop:
    1. Is the decision already ANSWERED below? Then it is not open. Use it, cite the ID.
    2. Is it OPEN below? Then do not re-ask it. Reference the ID and plan around it.
    3. Neither? Only then is it new -- and even then, most product values are decided
       and recorded in ASSUMPTIONS rather than escalated. See FACTORY_RULES §7.

  A human answers by moving an entry to Answered and writing the value. That single
  edit unblocks everything listed against it.
