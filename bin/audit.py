"""Audit the MACHINERY, not your repo.

    python bin/audit.py                 # the shipped template
    python bin/audit.py --repo ../tally # a factory somebody installed

`factory doctor` asks "is this repository set up correctly?" -- protected files,
a real holdout, a calibrated ratchet, a channel that can reach you. This asks a
different question: **is the machinery underneath it still sound?**

A correctly configured repo running broken machinery passes every check the doctor
has. The findings here are bugs in the factory rather than gaps in your setup.

WHY IT EXISTS. Every check below is a failure shape that actually happened, and every
one of them was invisible to both the doctor and to Archon's own workflow validation
-- because each is a property that spans two files. A node emits a value; a different
node reads it. A state exists in one table; its label lives in another. A marker is
required by config; the thing that prints it is a harness the config has never seen.

Nothing here needs an API key, a model, or a running app. It reads files.
